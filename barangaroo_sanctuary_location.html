            <p>This location is dedicated to helping sick and injured animals! All of the animals that are featured on
                this page have or had an illness which has forced them away from their natural habitat. While
                adventuring through the area I was able to meet some of the workers who look after these animals! I hope
                you are able to travel to this destination to meet these animals!</p>

                <p>The two Tasmanian Devils that live at Barangaroo Wildlife Sanctuary are called Odin and Thor, by the
                    carers. These
                    two brothers are blind and are unable to survive on the wild by themselves. While exploring their
                    area, I observed that their habitat includes fallen logs which allows these animals to hide from
                    danger. Amazing!

                <p>This wombat is called Milly by the carers at Barangaroo Wildlife Sanctuary. While observing her, I
                    discovered that a
                    wombat's butt is purely fat. This means that a wombat that is being attacked can plug up their
                    burrow
                    with their butt and not feel a thing!
